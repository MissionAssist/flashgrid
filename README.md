FlashGrid
==========

An Anki addon for drilling flashcards by selecting the correct card from a grid layout of several cards.
See the Anki website's list of provided addons.

v0.21 tries to handle the 'not found' error by replacing it with an empty cell.

Since this runs under Anki and I have been unsuccessful running Anki from source to enable debugging,
it is not as refined as I should have liked.
